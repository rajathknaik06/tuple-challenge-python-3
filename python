""" Riley is analyzing DNA sequences and needs to determine which bases match at the same positions in two given DNA sequences. Each DNA sequence is represented as a tuple of integers, where each integer corresponds to a DNA base. 



Your task is to write a program that compares these two sequences and identifies the bases that match at the same positions and print it.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the size of the first tuple.

The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the first DNA sequence tuple.

The third line of input consists of an integer m, representing the size of the second tuple.

The fourth line contains m space-separated integers, representing the elements of the second DNA sequence tuple.

Output format :
The output is a space-separated integer of the matching bases at the same positions in both sequences.

"""

# Read the size of the first tuple
size1 = int(input().strip())
# Read the first tuple
dna1 = tuple(map(int, input().strip().split()))

# Read the size of the second tuple
size2 = int(input().strip())
# Read the second tuple
dna2 = tuple(map(int, input().strip().split()))

# Initialize a list for matching bases
matching_bases = []

# Check if both tuples are of the same size
if size1 == size2:
    # Iterate over the tuples and compare
    for i in range(size1):
        if dna1[i] == dna2[i]:
            matching_bases.append(dna1[i])

# Print the result
if len(matching_bases) == 1:
    print(matching_bases[0])
elif len(matching_bases) > 1:
    print(' '.join(map(str, matching_bases)))
